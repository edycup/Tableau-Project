## 🌍 Project 1: Global Health Insights
**Scenario:** acting as a data analyst for a global health organization to understand disparities across continents.

### 🔍 Key Analysis
I utilized the **Gapminder Health dataset** to visualize life expectancy and health metrics. The dashboard answers critical questions regarding:
* **Life Expectancy by Continent:** A comparative analysis of the most recent data.
* **Trends Over Time:** A line chart tracking the top 5 countries with the highest average life expectancy.
* **Health Correlations:** A scatter plot investigating the relationship between **BMI** and **Life Expectancy**.

### 💡 Insights Discovered
**BMI Correlation:** Countries with higher BMI tend to cluster around mid-to-high life expectancy, though extremes in BMI correlate with lower life expectancy.
**Population Growth:** Africa and Asia show the steepest population growth curves, while Europe remains relatively stable.
**NHS Application:** These benchmarks can be used to assess whether local life expectancy is improving at a comparable rate to peer nations.

## 🎧 Project 2: Spotify Musical Features Analysis
**Objective:** Analyze the "SpotifyFeatures" dataset to identify trends in popularity, genre, and musical attributes for future organization projects.

### 🔍 Key Analysis
I explored correlations between technical musical attributes (Energy, Valence, Tempo) and popularity. Key visualizations included:
* **Genre Popularity:** Ranking top genres by popularity score.
* **Tempo vs. Energy:** A scatter plot analyzing the intensity of tracks.
* **Key Mode Distribution:** Comparing Major vs. Minor keys.

### 💡 Insights Discovered
**Top Genres:** **Pop** is the most popular genre, followed by Rap, Rock, and Hip-Hop.
**Musical Mood:** 66.73% of tracks are in a **Major key**, suggesting popular music generally conveys a happier or brighter tone.
**Tempo Dynamics:** There is a visual link between Tempo and Energy; high-energy genres (Rap/Pop) have faster tempos, while complex genres (Opera) are slower.
